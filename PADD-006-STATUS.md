  - ⚠️ Lines: 83.69% (below target)

## 📊 Detailed Coverage Analysis

### Contract-Specific Coverage

| Contract | Statements | Branch | Functions | Lines | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **PADToken** | 95.65% | 73.33% | 88.89% | 96.67% | ✅ Good |
| **MultiStakeManager** | 85.96% | 59.38% | 88.89% | 85.71% | ⚠️ Needs Branch |
| **PADNFTFactory** | 94.74% | 66.67% | 85.71% | 95.65% | ⚠️ Needs Branch |
| **TierCalculator** | 66.67% | 62.5% | 100% | 50% | ❌ Needs Work |
| **DateUtils** | 33.33% | 0% | 50% | 33.33% | ❌ Not Tested |

### Areas Needing Improvement

1. **TierCalculator**: Low line coverage (50%) - missing edge cases
2. **DateUtils**: Not tested at all - needs test implementation
3. **Branch Coverage**: Overall low (58.87%) - need more conditional tests
4. **MultiStakeManager**: Missing some branch scenarios

## 🚀 Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Immediate Actions
- Add tests for `DateUtils` library
- Improve `TierCalculator` test coverage
- Add more edge case tests for better branch coverage

### 2. Foundry Integration
- Try Foundry installation on Linux/WSL
- Or use alternative testing frameworks
- Consider Docker-based Foundry setup

### 3. Coverage Enhancement
- Target specific uncovered branches
- Add integration tests
- Implement property-based testing

## 📈 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Test Execution | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| Coverage Measurement | Configured | Configured | ✅ |
| CI/CD Setup | Complete | Complete | ✅ |
| Documentation | Complete | Complete | ✅ |
| Foundry Tests | Created | Created | ⚠️ |
| Coverage Targets | >90% | 80.33% | ⚠️ |

## 🎯 Overall Assessment

**PADD-006 Completion: 85%**

- ✅ Core testing infrastructure complete
- ✅ Coverage measurement working
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
- ⚠️ Foundry tests created but not executed
- ⚠️ Coverage targets not fully met

The task is **substantially complete** with working test infrastructure and coverage measurement. The main gaps are Foundry execution (due to environment constraints) and coverage targets (which can be improved with additional tests).
